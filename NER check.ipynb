       " '3/2': \"For nearly two years , PlasticsToday has followed the trials and tribulations of advanced recycling technologies \\x97 the good ( what little there is ) , the bad , and the ugly . On July 29 , Reuters released a report on this same topic that does n't contain much that is new ; rather , it covers the ongoing problem of companies that have been making promises to solve the plastic waste challenges for the past decade ( or longer ) , and noting their failure to fulfill those promises .\",\n",
       " '3/3': \"The report begins by calling out Renewlogy , founded by Priyanka Bakaya , who has made several attempts to find a solution to plastic waste through her pyrolysis process . The Salt Lake City facility contracted with Boise , ID , to take hard - to - recycle plastic waste through Dow 's orange Hefty Energy Bag program and turn it into fuel . It did n't turn out that way . The Salt Lake facility never got up and running , and Boise found itself renting warehouse space to store the collected orange bags until the city finally began sending the orange bags to a cement kiln to burn for energy .\",\n",
       " '3/4': 'Reuters reached out to Bakaya and she emailed them a response claiming that the program did n\\'t work because the plastic recyclate was \\\\\" contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect . \\\\\"',\n",
       " '3/5': 'Dirty recyclate is a major problem with advanced recycling . Like mechanical recycling , advanced recycling needs clean recyclate free of contamination in order to produce the quality of product that customers of these fuels and base chemicals need for their processes and products .',\n",
       " '3/6': 'To produce its report , Reuters said it examined 30 projects by two - dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry . What Reuters found was not surprising : \\\\\" Most of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemicals companies or consumer brands , including ExxonMobil Corp. , Royal Dutch Shell Plc , and Procter & Gamble Co ( P&G ) . All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down , and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans , \\\\\" said Reuters .',\n",
       " '3/7': 'Loop Industries closes South Korean deal',\n",
       " '3/8': \"I can add one more to the list . Loop Industries , which PlasticsToday has followed for several years , announced on Aug. 2 , 2021 , that it has closed on the $ 56.5 million deal with SK Global Chemical Co. Ltd. The South Korean firm will purchase treasury common shares of Loop Industries at $ 12 per share . SKGC now owns 10 % of Loop 's common shares . The agreement , first announced on June 23 , intends to accelerate the commercialization of Loop 's technology throughout Asia to supply global CPG brand companies with virgin - quality PET resin and polyester fiber made from 100 % recycled material , starting with a first facility in Ulsan , South Korea . Preparation is expected to begin in 2022 to build a minimum of four facilities by 2030 . Combined , these facilities are expected to process approximately 400,000 tons of PET and polyester fiber waste annually .\",\n",
       " '3/9': \"I 've heard similar promises from a number of these advanced recycling startups over the past five years . We 'll be watching , but not holding our breath .\",\n",
       " '3/10': 'By the way , Renewlogy also built a plant in Halifax , Nova Scotia , in collaboration with Halifax Sustane . The PK Clean plastics - to - fuel plant was announced in the publication Canadian Plastics on May 9 , 2017 , and in Waste 360 on July 18 , 2017 , touting that the facility would be capable of producing 832,142 gallons of synthetic fuel annually . The facility was to be completed by December 2017 with the first fuel production output in early 2018 . My last inquiries to Sustane as to whether the plant has been built and is operational went unanswered .',\n",
       " '3/11': \"Bakaya also took a stab at getting Phoenix on board with Renewlogy 's technology . So far that has n't been realized , despite several announcements over the past two years .\",\n",
       " '3/12': '\\\\\" Pyrolysis has been tried before on plastic , \\\\\" noted Reuters . \\\\\" British oil giant BP Plc , German chemical maker BASF SE , and US oil company Texaco Inc. \\x97 now owned by Chevron Corp. \\x97 all separately dropped plans to scale up waste - to - fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems . \\\\\"',\n",

       " '3/14': 'Reuters \\' report concludes that the driver for these advanced recycling technologies is the pressure brought to bear on big companies and the passage of \\\\\" polluter - pays \\\\\" laws \\\\\" that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make the plastic we use . \\\\\" It \\'s obvious that Reuters has it a bit wrong . If these laws were really about the polluter paying , then consumers , the people who run waste management companies , and municipalities that do not have good infrastructure in place should pay . They are the ones polluting , after all .',\n",
       " '3/15': \"Producer - pays laws are n't effective because the producers of plastic materials and the manufacturers that use plastics in the production of their goods are not responsible for what consumers do with the plastic packaging and products after the useful end of life .\",\n",
       " '3/16': 'PureCycle is also mentioned in the Reuters report , which notes that the company is one of three that it examined that has gone public . PureCycle went public through a special purchase acquisition company ( SPAC ) , and \\\\\" ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13 % to $ 33 , giving it a market capitalization of around $ 3.8 billion . \\\\\"',\n",
       " '3/17': \"It 's difficult to imagine a company having a market cap of nearly $ 4 billion with no product to sell , only promises of technology licensed from P&G capable of recycling polypropylene . P&G obviously did n't want to carry this process forward itself ; instead , it recently partnered with Eastman to use its molecular recycling technology to achieve its sustainability goals . It still claims that PureCycle offers another alternative to advanced recycling . P&G did n't provide comment to the Reuters report .\",\n",
       " '3/18': 'Enerkem , which PlasticsToday has covered in the recent past , announced a joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell Plc in March 2019 with promises to produce bio - methanol fuel . A news announcement in December 2020 said that Shell Canada was buying a 40 % interest in Enerkem to construct a C$ 875 million commercial - scale facility in Varennes , Quebec . Enerkem has been in this business since 2000 \\x97 more than two decades \\x97 and so far all the company has produced are promises .',\n",
       " '3/19': 'According to Reuters , two sources \\\\\" directly involved with the project \\\\\" said that it was canceled late last year due to \\\\\" uncertainly about the plants \\' availability to secure a reliable waste supply and to turn a profit . \\\\\" Enerkem , however , told Reuters that the \\\\\" project was never canceled , rather \\' repurposed \\' to focus on making jet fuel . \\\\\" Shell told Reuters it will make a decision on further investment in this venture in 2022 .',\n",
       " '3/20': 'Like so many of these advanced technology companies , the one thing they seem to forget is that in spite of the \\\\\" green \\\\\" altruism they spout , the ultimate goal is to create profits .',\n",
       " '3/21': 'Did you say \\\\\" potentially \\\\\" ?',\n",
       " '3/22': 'Many in the plastics industry push advanced recycling laws that some 14 US states have adopted to promote projects that promise to add jobs . Unfortunately , many never become a reality , nor will they ever be a viable solution to the plastic waste problem . Reuters notes that \\\\\" at least four high - profile projects have been dropped or indefinitely delayed over the last two years because they were n\\'t commercially viable . \\\\\"',\n",
       " '3/23': 'The American Chemistry Council ( ACC ) is urging lawmakers to \\\\\" ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies , \\\\\" reported Reuters . That would be all well and good , if these projects were actually viable . Reuters reports that the ACC says \\\\\" these technologies are game - changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic , eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning . \\\\\" ACC Vice President of the plastics division Joshua Baca told Reuters : \\\\\" The potential is enormous , \\\\\" adding that the organization called on Congress to \\\\\" develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste , including \\' rapid scaling \\' of advanced recycling . \\\\\"',\n",
       " '3/24': 'Those all sound like great ideas but there are those catch - words \\x97 potentially and potential \\x97 and therein lies the problem . In the advanced recycling business there \\'s no such thing as \\\\\" rapid scaling \\\\\" \\x97 many of these companies have been in the development phase of these technologies for nearly two decades and have yet to produce a gallon of anything .

       " '4/12': 'Compatible with up to 16â\\x80³ MacBook',\n",
       " '4/13': \"First things first , let 's talk about the actual quality of the Incase Commuter Backpack , as well as the other gear in the lineup . Relying on 100 % recycled plastic is sure to raise a few eyebrows and pique the curiosity of many , so how durable does it all feel ? Actually really solid . The Incase BIONIC releases do have a plastic - like feel to them , but not in a negative way . It 's all quite premium and has some nice stitching throughout to add to the durable design . Everything also comes in one of two new colors , Baltic Sea and Sand , which I find particularly appealing .\",\n",
       " '4/14': \"Turning our attention to the Commuter Backpack itself , this is the Incase BIONIC product that uses the most recycled materials in its build , with 26 plastic bottles making up the bag . Certainly on the smaller side , it has a single compartment with an integrated laptop sleeve that 's able to accommodate my 16 - inch MacBook Pro with ease .\",\n",
       " '4/15': 'Alongside the Incase Commuter Backpack , we also took a hands - on look at two of the companion accessories . Both the Compact Sleeve and Accessory Organizer arrive with much the same recycled emphasis as the main bag , just in different form factors .',\n",
       " '4/16': \"Available in both 13- and 16 - inch models , the Incase Compact Sleeve has a padded design that fits quite snug around your device . I 've personally been testing out the larger of the two , and quite enjoy that it also has a zipped pocket on the outside for throwing in a charging cord or USB - C hub . But the real letdown was it does n't have enough room to fit Apple 's entire 96W charger and cable into the sleeve with your computer , which does limit its versatility a bit .\",\n",
       " '4/17': \"As for the Incase Accessory Organizer , the compact design unzips in order to yield plenty of room for cables , chargers , and even power banks . Outside of just how versatile it is , there 's not too much to write home about here . It 's a pretty neat accessory if you have a loaded everyday carry that could use some organization .\",\n",
       " '4/18': \"As for the price on all of the Incase BIONIC gear I 've tested out here , these certainly are n't cheap . There 's no hiding that you 're paying a premium for the recycled gear , despite the lack of having more expansive feature sets . Even so , that value proposition is going to appeal to a lot of folks , given the environmental impact these will have . And even if it is only around seven bottles at a time , the trade - offs here are certainly worth it for the final product .\",\n",
       " '5/1': 'Cattle stomachs help break down plastic',\n",
       " '5/2': 'New results from a group of researchers at the Austrian Centre of Industrial Biotechnology ( acib ) and BOKU Vienna show that bacteria from cow stomachs can be used to degrade polyesters , which are used to make textiles , packaging and compostable plastic bags , among other things . On the one hand , the research findings shed light on microbial communities that reside within the ruminal fluid in cattle rumen and had been little studied in terms of plastic degradation . On the other hand , the research findings could provide a sustainable option for reducing plastic waste .',\n",
       " '5/3': 'More and more plastic waste is being produced in Europe . There are now almost 26 million tonnes of waste ( as of 2019 ) in our environment and oceans , of which approximately 15 percent is polyester . Public awareness and government bans on single - use plastic items are driving developments to prevent this problem by recycling and reusing plastic . However , many common solutions are energy intensive , unsustainable due to the use of toxic chemicals , and unable to break down plastics from mixed waste streams , for example .',\n",
       " '5/4': '\\\\\" Plastic , while difficult to break down , is similar in many ways to the structure of natural polyesters such as cutin , one of the main components of the plant cell . Cutin can be found in compost piles , for example , where it is broken down by natural enzymes . This gave us the idea to look for enzymes in other places as well \\\\\" , explains Doris Ribitsch , senior researcher at acib and researcher at the Institute of Environmental Biotechnology at BOKU Vienna . Since the feed of cows already contains natural plant polyesters , which are broken down and digested by the ruminal fluid in the bovine rumen , a part of the cow \\'s stomach , the researchers ventured a closer look into the microbial composition of the ruminal fluid - and made a find .',\n",
       " '5/5': 'Recycling - from plant polymer to commercial plastic',\n",
       " '5/6': '\\\\\" A huge microbial community lives in the rumen reticulum , which is responsible for the digestion of food in animals . Therefore , we suspected that some biological activities might also be used for the hydrolysis of plastics , \\\\\" said Ribitsch describing the enzymatic reaction that is responsible for the decomposition of plastics into their original building blocks - monomers and oligomers . These building blocks can subsequently be used to produce either new polymers or completely different molecules .',\n",
       " '5/7': 'Three types of polymers investigated',\n",
       " '5/8': 'The researchers investigated three types of polyesters : one , commonly known as PET , is a synthetic polymer that is often used in textiles and packaging . The other two were a biodegradable plastic commonly used in compostable plastic bags ( PBAT ) and a bio - based material made from renewable resources .',\n",
       " '5/9': 'To obtain the microorganisms to be tested , rumen fluid was obtained from an Austrian slaughterhouse . The researchers then brought this fluid into contact with the three types of plastic being tested to determine how effectively the plastic could be degraded . The groundbreaking results , recently published in the prestigious journal Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology , show that all three plastics can be degraded by the microorganisms from cow stomachs . Compared to similar research that mostly studied individual microorganisms , Ribitsch and her colleagues found that the rumen fluid was more effective , which may suggest that the microbial community has a synergistic advantage . Ribitsch said , \\\\\" In nature , complex molecules such as lignin , a component of wood , are degraded by enzyme cascades , a collaboration of several microorganisms . We assume that it will also take an interplay of several enzymes isolated from the bovine rumen to ensure an overall degradation of polyester . \\\\\"',\n",
       " '5/10': 'New process works , more projects needed',\n",
       " '5/11': 'To date , the research has been conducted on a laboratory scale . \\\\\" Due to the large quantities of rumen produced in slaughterhouses every day , upscaling would be easy to imagine , \\\\\" Ribitsch believes the process can also be implemented on an industrial scale .

That 's a lot pricier than the jumbo boxes of disposable trash bags that we 're used to buying , but TOMbag 's version is designed to last years , which means the cost evens out over time .\",\n",
       " '18/4': \"The company is responding to a common environmental problem : Most trash bags end up in a landfill and do not biodegrade . Over the past few years , brands like BioBag and Green Paper Products have started creating more sustainable alternatives to traditional single - use plastic bags , but they too are problematic . Recycled plastic bags still do not decompose , and compostable plastic bags do not biodegrade unless they end up in the high - pressure , high - heat environment of an industrial composting facility . In other words , compostable bags are eco - friendly only if you 're using them for compost ; if you 're using them for regular trash or recycling , they 're basically just as problematic as plastic .\",\n",
       " '18/5': 'Sasha and Johnathan Pestano , the husband - and - wife duo who founded TOMbag , started to realize the extent of the problem two years ago . They were spurred to live as sustainably as possible after the birth of their daughter in an effort to keep the planet livable for her . And while they encountered plenty of swaps for everyday plastic items , they realized they did n\\'t have a good alternative to single - use plastic trash bags . In 2019 , when they began working on the company , 3.3 billion trash bags were used and tossed in Australia alone . \\\\\" Here we are bringing reusable metal straws and tote bags around with us , and yet we \\'re continuing to use multiple plastic trash bags every week , \\\\\" Sasha says .',\n",
       " '18/6': 'When they looked into municipal policies around trash collection in Australia , they discovered that most counties did not require trash to be contained in plastic bags ; the trash simply needed to be properly contained within the curbside bins . The same policies apply to most towns in the U.S. ( though the founders recommend looking up the rules in your neighborhood to make sure ) . \\\\\" A small number of counties still require plastic trash bags , largely because they \\'re worried about small particles of trash — like debris from a vacuum cleaner — getting swept away by the wind , \\\\\" Johnathan explains . \\\\\" But in many places , including Sydney , counties are actually encouraging people to use reusable trash bags to cut down on the area \\'s plastic waste . \\\\\"',\n",

And there 's a drawstring at the top of the bag to keep trash in while you carry it .\",\n",

When the bag reaches the end of its life , customers can send it back to TOMbag , where it will be recycled . \\\\\" We wanted to create a fully circular system , so we \\'re not adding to the plastic waste problem in any way , \\\\\" Sasha says .',\n",
       " '18/10': \"The Pestanos recognize that this approach to handling household trash takes some getting used to . For one thing , it forces people to get up close and personal with their trash , since they have to pour all of it out into the bin every few days . This can be a stinky business . But Sasha points out that there are many ways to mitigate the smell . For instance , households that compost are already separating their food scraps into a separate bin , which means that most of the rest of their trash tends to be dry . ( Australia is mandating that every household use compost bins by 2030 . ) Sasha says that some of TOMbag 's customers actually appreciate taking stock of how much trash they are producing .\",\n",

That said , many places around the world — including the European Union and Mexico City — are beginning to impose bans on single - use plastic , including straws and grocery bags . It 's possible that over time , single - use trash bags may be added to the list , and consumers will be forced to look for a reusable alternative .

It says the recycling programs are not accessible or transparent , and the vast majority of packaging still winds up in the landfill or ocean despite conscious consumers \\' best efforts .

It was included in Time 's 2021 list of the world 's 100 most influential companies . During the pandemic , the boxes it sells to consumers saw double - digit sales growth .\",\n",
       " '19/15': \"TerraCycle 's Hungarian - born founder Tom Szaky looks like your typical hippie entrepreneur , with shaggy brown hair and a beard . We spoke over Zoom , him beaming in from a large office space lined with curtains made of empty plastic water bottles . He founded TerraCycle in 2001 while a first - year student at Princeton . At first , he collected food waste and sold the compost to local businesses . Later he pivoted to processing packaging , and in 2007 got his first brand partners — Honest Tea , Stonyfield Farm , and Clif Bar — which paid TerraCycle to set up collection points for their packaging . Since then , TerraCycle has expanded globally and has partnered with more than 500 brands for all sorts of stuff , including Teva for its sandals and both Hasbro and Mattel for their toys .\",\n",

With factoids like \\\\\" By 2050 , our oceans will have more plastic than fish , \\\\\" videos of marine life being strangled , and news stories about dead whales full of plastic zinging around the internet , companies have been under increasing pressure from consumers and governments to do something about the global plastic pollution problem .',\n",
       " '19/17': \"Szaky 's pitch is that our recycling system is broken . Because it 's increasingly labor intensive to recycle our complicated modern packaging , and because China stopped accepting most waste from the US in 2018 , it has become less and less profitable to collect and recycle disposable products . Many municipalities are finding they ca n't afford to do anything but throw it all in the landfill or incinerate it .\",\n",
       " '19/18': \"Szaky 's solution is to get corporations and consumers to pay for it .\",\n",
       " '19/19': \"Here 's how it works : Once corporations partner with TerraCycle and pay a fee ( the cost of which neither TerraCycle nor its partners have revealed ) , they can tell consumers on their websites and on their packaging that it is recyclable through TerraCycle . Consumers , schools , and businesses are encouraged to sign up for each free recycling program separately at TerraCycle 's website . For each program they are approved for , they receive a shipping label or collection container . They fill it with the specified waste from the sponsoring brand and send it in for recycling . Some brands send a few cents per item to charity as an incentive .\",\n",
       " '19/20': \"TerraCycle then pays plastic manufacturers in the US to recycle these products . Szaky says the wrappers , for example , are melted down and extruded into a copolymer that TerraCycle then sells to American manufacturers of products like garbage cans , Frisbees , benches , and shipping pallets — bulky things that do n't need precision - molded , high - quality virgin plastic . ( Though many would consider this downcycling , not recycling . ) It was in the negative by $ 1.1 million in 2020 on this part of its business .\",\n",
       " '19/21': \"Participating in a TerraCycle recycling program is not that easy , though . To recycle your used Honest Kids drink pouches or K - Y Jelly tubes for free , you have to either find a local drop - off site ( which might be too far away ) or sign up to receive mailing materials at TerraCycle 's website ( an option that often involves a months - long waitlist ) .\",\n",
       " '19/22': \"If you can get a shipping label , you then need to save up , clean , and separate your spent packaging and take it to UPS to be shipped off to the company 's warehouse in New Jersey . TerraCycle encourages you to wait until you have a certain weight of trash to send off , to keep the emissions of shipping down . So , you need to either go through a lot of K - Y Jelly , for example , or find other people passionate enough about plastic waste to save their tubes and give them all to you .\",\n",
       " '19/23': 'Szaky defends TerraCycle \\'s limits by saying that it gives access to recycling to all consumers who want to recycle items and make the effort to do so . But for some programs , like Gillette razor blades , there are n\\'t even public drop - off locations in Brooklyn , one of the most dense ( and self - consciously sustainable ) areas in the US — everything is registered at apartment addresses . Szaky says the lack of locations is because Gillette \\'s program is only a year old and that not enough people have signed up to set up collection points yet . But that again puts the onus on consumers instead of Gillette to set up and run collection points on their own time . Gillette \\'s program is really only \\\\\" free \\\\\" if you consider everyone \\'s time and labor worthless .',\n",
       " '19/24': \"If TerraCycle 's free , corporate - sponsored program is n't available for a given product , TerraCycle will sell you a container that you can fill according to the box 's theme — toys , hair salon waste , and kitchen waste are a few of the dozens of categories — and ship to TerraCycle . If you want to keep going , you then need to buy another box . These boxes are not cheap . The bestselling small all - in - one box , which will take pretty much anything and measures 11 x 11 x 20 inches , costs $ 199 — prohibitively expensive for all but the most privileged and committed consumers .\",\n",
       " '19/25': \"And yet , consumer boxes count for a not - insignificant part of TerraCycle 's revenue . In 2020 , according to TerraCycle 's financial filing in preparation for a potential IPO , its US division generated $ 25 million in net sales , $ 7.5 million of which came from its boxes . $ 10.5 million came from the more than 45 partnering brands listed on TerraCycle 's site , which means each company is spending what amounts to less than a rounding error of their operations .\",\n",
       " '19/26': 'TerraCycle has a similarly itsy - bitsy recycling volume . Szaky told Vox that TerraCycle , on average , collects 217 tons of waste per month through its mail - in program from the entire continental United States . The small town of Mamaroneck , New York , recycles more than that in a year . New York City alone produces 12,000 tons of waste per day .',\n",
       " '19/27': \"Even for specific categories , the waste collected is so vanishingly small as to be almost negligible . Szaky says TerraCycle has recycled 370,000 Bic pens this year . That 's a big number , but it amounts to recycling just 0.02 percent of the estimated 1.6 billion ballpoint pens thrown out in the US every year . Two - hundredths of a percent is not technically nothing . But it is close .\",\n",
       " '19/28': 'This minuscule investment by corporations seems to be more of a marketing ploy than pointing to an actual shift in their operations . In other words , corporations seem to be paying TerraCycle to help them greenwash , whether Szaky knows it or not . A 2020 report by the Changing Markets Foundation claimed the largest conglomerates in the world , including Coca - Cola , Nestlé , and Colgate - Palmolive , make voluntary pledges and support small take - back schemes as a tactic to take the air out of anti - plastic movements .',\n",
       " '19/29': \"TerraCycle is frequently mentioned in the report as the tool corporations use to make it look like they 're moving toward reusable and recyclable containers , while at the same time they aggressively lobby against anti - plastic legislation . For example , the report says Coca - Cola , PepsiCo , Nestlé , and Tetra Pak spent between € 300,000 and € 1.2 million in 2018 lobbying against the European Union 's Single - Use Plastic Directive . ( This lobbying effort failed ; the SUP Directive became EU law just a few weeks ago . )\",\n",
       " '19/30': 'Szaky has aligned himself with the interests of these big businesses . \\\\\" It \\'s much better to focus on and empathize with their goals — whether you agree with them or not , frankly , \\\\\" Szaky said in an interview this past May. \\\\\" Even if it \\'s as uninspired as \\' I want to sell more stuff . \\' \\\\\"',\n",
       " '19/31': 'He also has said that , because companies pay for TerraCycle \\'s recycling programs , they are \\\\\" even more motivated \\\\\" to improve the design so they can cut the cost of TerraCycle \\'s recycling program , and that TerraCycle often provides consulting services to brands that want to make their packaging more frequently recyclable . Gerber , with the help of TerraCycle \\'s feedback , made its squeeze pouches easier and less expensive for TerraCycle to process . These squeeze packs are not yet , however , curbside recyclable .',\n",
       " '19/32': 'The question remains : If corporations can set a low cut - off point for how much they will pay for each recycling program ( the largest programs are in the seven figures , which is hilariously small for a global behemoth like Nestlé , which made $ 13.49 billion in profit in 2020 , how are they incentivized to do anything more than the bare minimum ?',\n",
       " '19/33': 'TerraCycle \\'s own employees have trouble with this business model . \\\\\" Most people joining our company have to be trained ... because people are so mission - driven , \\\\\" Szaky has said . \\\\\" It \\'s almost like , \\' F**k you , you should be responsible \\' — that emotion comes out . \\\\\"',\n",

The rest of the plastic is landfilled or burned , or shipped abroad to less - developed countries , where it is also piled in landfills or burned .\",\n",

That means its customers are paying more than $ 24 per pound ( $ 48,000 per ton ) to recycle food packaging waste .

By rolling the pouch into a semirigid shape and using the pre - adhered polyethylene ( PE ) label provided on the pouch to keep the structure in place , we change the format of the pouch . While typical flexible packaging pouches are two - dimensional when empty and can end up contaminating the paper stream in mechanical recycling facilities , the rolled pouch format instead moves through the various conveyer belts and into the plastics stream where it belongs .\",\n",

       " '78/3': 'Can you tell us a bit more of the development process for ReZorce ?',\n",
       " '78/4': \"David Stirling : The principle of ReZorce is very simple . It is made from high density polyethylene ( HDPE ) , with a few additives that do n't affect recycling . HDPE is used in many packaging applications , such as milk bottles , and is widely recycled across the world . The key difference is the structure . Instead of making a monolayer , we make multiple layers , solid foam on solid foam , which makes it very difficult for the oxygen and moisture molecules to travel through the product , and thus increasing the barrier properties . But it still is HDPE , and therefore it can be put in standard home recycling stream . The other benefit of having numerous layers is that it facilitates the use of recycled materials . As there is a shortage in high quality recycled material , we can put the recyclate in the inside layers , where it does n't touch the food .\",\n",
       " '78/5': \"Neil Court - Johnston : Everything that you can do today with cartonboard , we believe can be done with ReZorce . The material is also suitable for use in other applications , such as pouches or tubes , but we are starting with drinks cartons because that 's the most concentrated market , and the market where the recycling industry has the biggest pool .\",\n",
       " '78/6': 'Were there any challenges when it came to developing the material ?',\n",
       " '78/7': 'David Stirling : One of the biggest challenges , once we understood how to make the barrier structure , was the surface . When you foam any plastics , you usually get a slightly rough surface . It feels like orange peel and is difficult to print on . We spent quite a long time perfecting the surface to get the optimal print quality . Having the capability for surface printing is important as it enables on - pack labelling or mass customisation . This is a technology still in development , but we have a South American partner who is very close to commercialisation . We should be getting into production within a few months .',\n",
       " '78/8': \"David Stirling : In the future , certainly . Today , most countries do not allow recycled content to be mixed with food or beverages . But if you go into chemical recycling , it comes back essentially as virgin material . In our trials , the highest recycled content rate we achieved was around 70 % . We are starting with less than that because of availability of high volumes of good quality recycled materials , but the technology is future proof . As the recycling industry catches up , we can put more and more in . The volumes we 're talking about are large , we already have interest for over 500 million cartons . It becomes more difficult to source high quality at high volumes . We want to start at a reasonable level and then grow as the industry grows .\",\n",
